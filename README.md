### Abstract 
This paper explores the effects of alcohol consumption on the use of hard drugs, especially in relation to the increase in access to alcohol at 21 years of age, the minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) in the US. To explore this relationship, we created a new data set from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1997 (NLSY97), limited to the years 1998-2008, which merges variables related to alcohol consumption and hard drug use. We limited the data to respondents who provided information about their alcohol consumption and hard drug use, meaning substances other than marijuana, such as crack, cocaine, and heroin. Initially, we ran OLS and fixed effects regressions to examine the effects of alcohol consumption on hard drug use, both of which were dummy variables equal to 1 if the respondent had consumed alcohol or used hard drugs since their last interview, the year prior. Some of these models provided statistically significant results, but we felt we didnâ€™t have the full story. Ultimately, by using a regression discontinuity model, we found that alcohol consumption sharply increased at 21 years of age, and hard drug use generally decreased around this same threshold. However, we could not conclude that there exists a discontinuity in hard drug use at 21 years of age, so we cannot definitively claim that alcohol and hard drugs are used as substitutes. All of our estimates are robust to various specifications and clustered by individuals, which will be expanded upon in our Data section.
